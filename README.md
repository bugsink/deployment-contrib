# Bugsink Contributed Deployment Templates

A collection of examples on how [Bugsink](https://www.bugsink.com/) could be
deployed.

This is a separate repository to make it easier to contribute examples, while
making it clear that they have not been formally vetted by the Bugsink team.

Despite the lack of vetting, they have been known to be useful.
